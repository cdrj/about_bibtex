Abstract = {{This paper adopts two different approaches, the small-gain technique and

   interconnection is presented by employing the small-gain technique. In

   synchronisation problem and weighted containment tracking motion are
   respectively solved for the coupled harmonic oscillators. Compared with

   weight-product balanced, or if some leader groups are not interactively

Abstract = {{In this paper, a twisting-based consensus algorithm is put forward to

   order to remove the requirement of continuous monitoring, a pull-based
   triggering mechanism is employed. Simultaneously, the Zeno-behavior can
   be excluded under a finite-time dynamic condition. Then, due to the
   advantages of non-chattering behaviors and finite-time convergence, a
   twisting-based consensus algorithm based on homogeneous techniques is
   developed to drive the Euler-Lagrange systems to the consensus value in
   a settling time. By means of Polya's theorem and Sum of Squares tools, a
   polynomial Lyapunov function is constructed to verify our criteria. At

Abstract = {{Networked control systems are spatially distributed systems in which the

Abstract = {{This paper mainly focuses on synchronization of controlled
   drive-response systems under Lurie form through a limited channel. The
   main contribution of this paper is the quantizer-based triggered
   methodology proposed based on three coders. By exploring coder structure
   information and fusing quantization and trigger errors together, this
   strategy can reduce transmission burden while increase synchronization
   speed concurrently. And the final synchronization error can be bounded
   within a predetermined fixed value. According to the initial output of
   drive system, different coders are purposely designed. With the proposed
   trigger schemes, traditional binary coder with memory cannot achieve
   desired performance. Meanwhile, it is found that the static coder leads
   to satisfactory performance when initial drive system output is within
   limited region. Combining the advantages of the above two coders, a
   mixed coder is designed to overcome the shortcomings. Moreover,
   synchronization error and transmission bit rate are thoroughly discussed
   and Zeno behavior is radically prevented. Finally, simulations for two
   Chua's circuits are given to illustrate the validity of the proposed
   method.}},

   The proposed protocols only require that the union of communication

Abstract = {{For coupled harmonic oscillators (CHO), the paper studies the
   synchronization problem by using the quantized current sampled position
   data. The logarithmic quantizer is adopted here to quantize the
   information transmitted; thus the quantization error of the sampled
   position data can be illustrated as the uncertainty according to the
   sector bound property. On the basis of that, the synchronization problem
   is converted into the asymptotical stability of the subsystems and even
   the solving problem of characteristic equation. Some sufficient
   conditions ensuring the synchronization of CHO are obtained relating to
   coupling strength, sampling period, and quantizer parameter. The
   usefulness of the theoretical result is shown by an example at the end.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a networked heterogeneous system coupled of multiple
   nonidentical harmonic oscillators is investigated. The synchronization
   problem for the networked heterogeneous system is studied. To
   synchronize the heterogeneous network, a leader is introduced. Based on
   the pinning control, a distributed control input is proposed to
   synchronize the heterogeneous network to the leader. By Lyapunov
   functional method and matrix theory, sufficient conditions for
   guaranteeing quasi-synchronization between the heterogeneous network and
   the leader are obtained. The theoretical results show that all the
   heterogeneous oscillators can tend eventually to the leader oscillator
   within a bounded error. Finally, numerical simulations are provided to
   verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results.}},
